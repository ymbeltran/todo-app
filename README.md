## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Context. React useState. 
- Webpack
- Babel
- SASS & BEM
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to work with Webpack. I learned to use React Context (provider, consumer), React useState and handle the local storage. I also explored the use of BEM methodology.

### Continued development

For future projects I would like to practice writing comments while writing code because this time I forgot to do it.

### Useful resources

- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - This helped me to add the drag and drop feature. I loved this library.
- [How to add DRAG and DROP in React using react-beautiful-dnd | Tutorial [english subtitles]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZsMWorjtFI) - I followed this tutorial to use the library.
